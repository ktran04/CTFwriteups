5\. courage

client-side flawed logic / info disclosure

area = area of the screen here. go to ctf flag --> inspect --> see the area. write:

const screenW = screen.width;

const screenH = screen.height;

const innerW  = window.innerWidth;

const innerH  = window.innerHeight;

const result  = (screenW \* screenH) - (innerW \* innerH);

console.log({screenW, screenH, innerW, innerH, result});



to print the area to console. enter number in the area form. polysemy = different meanings of same words
